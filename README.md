Solutions of the excellent Advent of Code 2020.

The files are written in Lua but uses [ntangle.nvim](https://github.com/jbyuki/ntangle.nvim) to generate the script files.

For big numbers, which  are not supported by default in Lua, I uses an [external file](https://github.com/ennorehling/euler/blob/master/BigNum.lua).
